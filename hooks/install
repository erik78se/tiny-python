#
# install is run at the beginning of a charm lifecycle.
# The hook should be used to perform one-time setup operations,
# such as installing prerequisite software that will not change
# with configuration changes.
# Like all hooks this must be idempotent because there are scenarios
# where this hook can be run more than once.
