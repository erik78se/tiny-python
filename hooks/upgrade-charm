# 'upgrade-charm'
#
# upgrade-charm runs immediately after any upgrade operation that does
# not itself interrupt an existing error state. It should be used
# to reconcile local state written by some other version of the charm
# into whatever form it needs to take to be manipulated by the current version.
#
# While the forced upgrade functionality is intended as a developer tool,
# and is not generally suitable for end users, it's somewhat optimistic
# to depend on the functionality never being abused. In light of this,
# if you need to run an upgrade-charm hook before your other hooks will
# work correctly, it may be wise to preface all your other hooks with
# a quick call to your (idempotent) upgrade-charm.
